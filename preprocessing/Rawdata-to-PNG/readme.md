# Preprocessing:
The hdf5toPNG and fft processing are in hdf5_to_images.py
The script is not incredibly flexible, but it should be easy enough to run on a new set of hdf5 files

If you want to add a new set of labeled data (say from hdf5 files from 2020), you need to make a new set of label CSVs (by hand, sorry) noting which images have / lack gravity waves
